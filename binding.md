# Beam Binding System Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a binding resolution system that replaces the regular `TypingRule` with `BoundTypingRule` in the AST. This moves binding resolution from type checking time to AST construction time.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created `logic/bind.rs` Module
- **`BoundTypingRule`**: A typing rule where all rule variables have been resolved to actual AST nodes
- **`BoundPremise`**, **`BoundTypeSetting`**, **`BoundTypeAscription`**: Supporting structures for bound rules
- **`BoundTypingJudgment`** and **`BoundConclusion`**: Judgments and conclusions with resolved node references
- **`DefaultBindingResolver`**: Implementation that resolves rule variables to nodes using existing binding utilities
- **Traits**: `BindableNonTerminal` and `BindableASTNode` for convenient binding resolution

### 2. Updated AST Structures
- **Removed** `typing_rule: Option<TypingRule>` from `NonTerminal` and `ASTNode::Nonterminal`
- **Added** `bound_typing_rule: Option<Box<BoundTypingRule>>` to store resolved rules
- **Updated** all AST methods to work with bound rules instead of regular rules
- **Fixed** serialization to handle the new structure

### 3. Updated Parser and Other Components
- **Parser**: Modified to set `bound_typing_rule: None` with TODO comments for future implementation
- **TypeChecker**: Updated to expect bound rules (currently returns error since binding resolution isn't implemented in parser yet)
- **Serialization**: Updated to ignore rule metadata during deserialization since rules will be resolved at parse time

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Simplified Type Checking**
- No need to resolve bindings during type checking
- Type checker can directly access resolved nodes instead of searching by variable names
- Faster type checking since binding resolution happens once

### 2. **Better Error Messages** 
- Direct references to AST nodes enable precise error reporting
- Span information readily available for all rule references

### 3. **More Efficient**
- Binding resolution happens once during AST construction
- No repeated variable lookups during type checking
- Cached resolved references in the AST

### 4. **Cleaner Architecture**
- Clear separation between rule definition and rule application
- AST contains all necessary information for type checking
- No dependency on external binding context during type checking

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Core binding resolution data structures
- AST updates to use bound rules
- Compilation fixes across the codebase
- Basic binding resolution logic

ðŸš§ **Still Needed:**
- Integration of binding resolution into the parser
- Implementation of `apply_bound_rule` in the type checker
- Update of existing tests to use bound rules
- Performance testing and optimization

## Usage Example

```rust
// Create a sample AST node with bindings
let lambda_node = NonTerminal {
    value: "Lambda".to_string(),
    children: vec![variable_node, type_node, body_node],
    bound_typing_rule: None, // Will be populated during parsing
    // ...
};

// Resolve a typing rule to create a bound rule
let resolver = DefaultBindingResolver;
let bound_rule = resolver.resolve_rule(&typing_rule, &lambda_node)?;

// Bound rule now contains direct node references instead of variable names
for referenced_node in bound_rule.referenced_nodes() {
    println!("Rule references node: {}", referenced_node.value);
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate into Parser**: Modify the parser to resolve typing rules during AST construction
2. **Implement Bound Rule Type Checking**: Update the type checker to work with bound rules
3. **Update Tests**: Fix existing tests to use the new bound rule system
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize binding resolution for large ASTs

The foundation for efficient, resolved binding is now in place!
